Implement a Context Provider and Consumer
Create a React application that wraps the entire <App/> with a context provider, created using Context API. Then, create multiple components that act as consumers to your context, using it in various ways.

Specifically, build a counter that uses 3 separate components that subscribe to a common provider

Requirements
Create a Counter Provider component, which exposes the following state:
count - A number (default to 0)
increment - A reference to a function that increases the count
decrement - A reference to a function that decreases the count
In the index.js, import CounterContext and wrap <App /> in it, so that all child components can optionally subscribe to it as consumers.
Your <App /> component should simply pull in and render the following child components ...
Create the following child components that register as a .Consumer to the provided context.
<Incrementer /> - Renders a button that, when clicked, calls the increment() method in the Counter Provider
<Decrementer /> - Renders a button that, when clicked, calls the decrement() method in the Counter Provider
<Counter /> - Renders the current value of count from the Counter Provider
Provide good styling. Use the css-in-js methodology within the components themselves.
Testing
Do a deep mount of the app, and set tests to make assertions on the child components that consume context from the Provider.
Can they see context?
Can they interact via published functions?
